# Superslow

Superslow gives your agent superpowers. It's a complete software development
methodology for coding agents — a set of composable skills plus a bootstrap
that ensures the agent reaches for them at the right moments.

## About this fork

Superslow is a fork of [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)
at v5.1.0. The skill content and vocabulary (the `superpowers:` skill
prefix, the `using-superpowers` bootstrap) are preserved verbatim — the
*product* is Superslow, the *skills* are still called superpowers.

Upstream's full release history is archived at
[`UPSTREAM-RELEASE-NOTES.md`](./UPSTREAM-RELEASE-NOTES.md). Superslow's own
release notes live in [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Quickstart

Give your agent Superslow: [Claude Code](#claude-code) · [Codex CLI](#codex-cli) · [Cursor](#cursor) · [OpenCode](#opencode) · [Gemini CLI](#gemini-cli).

## How it works

From the moment you fire up your coding agent, Superslow steps in before
code gets written. It teases out a spec through conversation, presents it
in digestible chunks, then writes an implementation plan clear enough for
a junior engineer to follow. It enforces red/green TDD, YAGNI, and DRY,
and dispatches subagents per task with two-stage review. Skills trigger
automatically — you don't have to invoke them manually.

## Installation

Installation differs by harness. If you use more than one, install
Superslow separately for each.

### Claude Code

```
/plugin marketplace add slowdini/superslow
/plugin install superpowers@superslow
```

### Codex CLI

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add slowdini/superslow
```

Then install the `superpowers` plugin from the `superslow` marketplace
through Codex's plugin interface.

### Cursor

Cursor has no native git-install path. The Superslow installer clones the
repo (or reuses an existing checkout) and symlinks the plugin into Cursor's
local plugin directory.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slowdini/superslow/main/cursor/install.sh | sh
```

Review the script before running if you prefer:
<https://github.com/slowdini/superslow/blob/main/cursor/install.sh>

Restart Cursor after install.

### OpenCode

Tell OpenCode:

```
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slowdini/superslow/refs/heads/main/opencode/INSTALL.md
```

Detailed docs: [`opencode/INSTALL.md`](opencode/INSTALL.md).

### Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/slowdini/superslow
```

To update:

```bash
gemini extensions update superpowers
```

## The Basic Workflow

1. **brainstorming** — refines rough ideas through questions, explores
   alternatives, presents the design in sections for validation.
2. **using-git-worktrees** — creates an isolated workspace on a new branch
   after design approval.
3. **writing-plans** — breaks the work into bite-sized tasks with exact
   file paths and complete code.
4. **subagent-driven-development** — dispatches a fresh subagent per task
   with two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality).
5. **test-driven-development** — enforces RED-GREEN-REFACTOR.
6. **requesting-code-review** — reviews against the plan, reports issues
   by severity; critical issues block progress.
7. **finishing-a-development-branch** — verifies tests, presents options
   (merge, PR, keep, discard), cleans up the worktree.

The agent checks for relevant skills before any task. These are mandatory
workflows, not suggestions.

## What's inside

**Testing** — `test-driven-development`

**Debugging** — `systematic-debugging`, `verification-before-completion`

**Collaboration** — `brainstorming`, `writing-plans`,
`dispatching-parallel-agents`, `requesting-code-review`,
`receiving-code-review`, `using-git-worktrees`,
`finishing-a-development-branch`, `subagent-driven-development`

**Meta** — `writing-skills`, `using-superpowers`

## Philosophy

- Test-Driven Development — write tests first, always
- Systematic over ad-hoc — process over guessing
- Complexity reduction — simplicity as a primary goal
- Evidence over claims — verify before declaring success

## How it's distributed

Superslow is released across five agent handlers. Each harness reads a different set of files from this repository:

| File | Harness | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `package.json` | OpenCode | Plugin manifest (`@slowdini/superslow-opencode`), dev tooling scripts |
| `marketplace.json` | Claude Code | Marketplace registry pointing to `claude/` source |
| `claude/plugin.json` | Claude Code | Plugin manifest for Claude's `/plugin` system |
| `codex/plugin.json` | Codex CLI | Plugin manifest for Codex's plugin system |
| `cursor/.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` | Cursor | Cursor plugin manifest |
| `cursor/install.sh` | Cursor | Installation script (symlinked into `~/.cursor/plugins/local/`) |
| `gemini-extension.json` | Gemini CLI | Extension manifest (points to `gemini-instructions.md`) |
| `gemini-instructions.md` | Gemini CLI | Instructions loaded by Gemini on extension activation |
| `skills/` | All | Shared skill library |
| `assets/` | All | Shared assets (icons, images) |

## Repository structure

Flat layout — skills and assets live at root, harness-specific integration lives in top-level directories:

- `skills/` — All superpowers skills
- `assets/` — Icons and images shared across harnesses
- `tests/` — Cross-cutting and harness-specific tests
- `claude/` — Claude Code plugin manifest and hooks
- `codex/` — OpenAI Codex plugin manifest
- `cursor/` — Cursor plugin manifest, hooks, and install script
- `opencode/` — OpenCode plugin and installation docs
- `gemini-extension.json` + `gemini-instructions.md` — Gemini CLI extension
- `marketplace.json` — Claude Code marketplace registry
- `package.json` — OpenCode plugin manifest + dev tooling
